# WEEK 2

This week we look at the following concepts:

* Printing hello world
* Running a `.java` file
* Basic elements of a simple Java program
* Types - Primitives, Non-Primitive
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions
* Simple Data Structures

## How To Use This Repo?

To understand this repo, clone it and go through each file. Run the file as is and then make changes to the file. These changes could mimic the code in the file
or try something entirely new. For example when going through `JavaTypes.java`, create your own variables, try your own casting approaches, write your own operations. You can also try to create new files and repeat things learned in class. Sometimes there will be exercise prompts in the code file for you to try. Remember that making mistakes is an essential part of the learning process! Don't shy away from making them and then learn from them!


## `HelloWorld.java`

* How to print
* How to run the file
* Making changes to a file
* Syntax differences - curly braces, semicolon
* Comment differences
* Need a main function
* Name of the class must be the same as the file

## `JavaTypes.java`

* Types are necessary
* Types are explicit (in contrast with Python)
* Variable name convention
* Variables, types, declaring, and initialization
* Integer and Floating-point types
* Character types and String
* Casting
* Operations

## `Conditionals.java`

* `if`-`else` statements
* `switch` statements

## `FunctionsOrMethods.java`

* Basic syntax
* Javadoc
* parameter types
* Return type
